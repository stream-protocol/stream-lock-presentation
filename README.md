### Description

StreamLock is a web3-based smart lock system that utilizes the Solana blockchain and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to control access to locked physical spaces. It authenticates users by confirming their ownership of a specific NFT through the StreamPay web3 wallet app, which is connected to the Solana blockchain. This allows the Stream smart lock to only grant access to those individuals who hold the corresponding NFT.

The system has the potential to be used in a variety of spaces, such as co-working offices, event venues, and other exclusive locations where only NFT holders will have access, using their tickets or membership cards. This smart lock system not only allows for secure keyless entries but also allows for the creation of unique digital assets that can be used for exclusive access to physical spaces. The use of Web3 technology and blockchain is a stepping stone for creating a bridge between the digital and physical worlds and allows for new possibilities for access control, authentication, and exclusive experiences.

##### StreamPay Wallet Implementation

Using a Stream Locks, StreamPay mobile wallet application or Card for door access linked to the temporary ownership of an NFT in a smart contract. The device will check ownership of an NFT associated with a StreamWallet card and authorize access if owned.

This system uses a combination of an NFT (non-fungible token), a smart contract, and a StreamWallet card to control access to a physical location. The NFT represents temporary ownership of the location, and the smart contract is used to check if the person attempting to access the location is the current owner of the NFT. If they are, the StreamWallet card is authorized to open the door.

#### Summary:

- The system uses NFT as a temporary ownership for a physical location

- Smart contract is used to check if the person attempting to access the location is the current owner of the NFT

- If the person is the owner of the NFT, then the StreamWallet card is authorized to open the door by the StreamLocks device.

# StreamLock Presentation


### Project description

Using a Stream Locks, StreamPay mobile wallet application or Card for door access linked to the temporary ownership of an NFT in a smart contract. The device will check ownership of an NFT associated with a StreamWallet card and authorize access if owned.

This system uses a combination of an NFT (non-fungible token), a smart contract, and a StreamWallet card to control access to a physical location. The NFT represents temporary ownership of the location, and the smart contract is used to check if the person attempting to access the location is the current owner of the NFT. If they are, the StreamWallet card is authorized to open the door.

#### Summary:

- The system uses NFT as a temporary ownership for a physical location

- Smart contract is used to check if the person attempting to access the location is the current owner of the NFT

- If the person is the owner of the NFT, then the StreamWallet card is authorized to open the door by the StreamLocks device.
